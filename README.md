# MNIST-CNN-problem
The dataset consists of hand-written digit images taken from the MNIST dataset,
and the task is to retrieve the digit label at a specific location. Fig. 1 provides several
example images. Each image has three sub-images: the top image serves as a pointer
to the middle or bottom images. If the top image is a digit in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, then
the label of the whole image is the digit in the middle image (e.g., the first example
in Fig. 1 with the label “0”), otherwise, the top image is a digit in {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
and the label of the whole image is the digit in the bottom image (e.g., the second
example in Fig. 1 with the label “8”).
